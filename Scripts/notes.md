That's good advice!  Although it kinda implies that all scripts are unreliable, but I've found scripts attached to Decorations to be very reliable, although I don't recommend using "map quickreturn" with any Decoration with script. Instead use the "map return" command because it doesn't allow the player to spam the E key and potentially create odd behavior if the script has several stages/steps 


This is really good to know using map quick return allows you to hold down a key and continue to get output from whatever script and map return will be more towards MPC stuff
